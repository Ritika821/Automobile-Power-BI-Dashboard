# Automobile-Power-BI-Dashboard


## Introduction :

This project is about some specific Automobile brands. It contains data of cars like Alto, Beat, Santro, Hawk, Maruti 800 etc., its total sale, sold price, manager, dealers, consumer preference, zone, state and city in which it was sold of 2018-19. This makes easy to do comparison between these cars and where it is mostly sold. lastly it shows the top three and bottom three cars, states, and managers where quantities sold is highest or lowest. It covers the skill sets like Power BI as it is the best platform for data visualization in the most interactive ways. Also it shows various effective chart visuals which makes the dashboard easy to understand and attractive for the viewers. This will help the customers to compare between the best car brands and it will help the Car Companies to focus on those States where sale is higher than other States and plan for the future products according to that.

## Based on the report Insights, here are the outcomes :

In this project we have three Dashboards for more detailed analysis Quantity Based Dashboard, Revenue Based Dashboard and Top-Bottom Base Dashboard

1. In this Project, the first filter is month-wise which is there on the Revenue-Based Dashboard. Through the filters I got that in January, quantity sold and sold price together are high followed by February month whereas both are low in July month.

2. In this Project, the second filter is Manager-wise which is on the Manager-Based Dashboard. Through the filters I got that Rajat Mrig has done high sales than others but generated lesser revenue than others and Ajay, Ishal Waliya, Ranjit Singhand Venkata Rao has generated highest revenue than others whereas Ruby Bhatia has done low sales than other and Pranay Seth has generated lowest revenue than others.

3. (a) From this Pie Chart of Zone, I came to know that West Zone has highest sale of Cars i.e. 3k followed by South whereas East Zone has lowest sale of Cars i.e. 1k.

</a></p>

3. (b) In this I have used Funnel Chart which shows that West side has generated highest revenue followed by South whereas North and East has generated least revenue.

</a></p>

4. I have used Line Chart for this data in which it shows that Basic Cars are mostly sold also followed by Luxury one whereas Extra Class Cars are least sold.

</a></p>

5. Total quantity sold within period 2018-19 is 9673 Cars and crossed the target i.e. 8500 Cars, for which I have used Gauge Chart to display it clearly. The difference between the Target and Current Sale is 1173.

</a></p>

6. In case of Cars where Alto is on the top for maximum Sales followed by Santro whereas Punto is at the last position for total sales.

</a></p>

7. (a) In this Project, I got that Punjab has highest sale of cars followed by Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh whereas Assam has lowest sale of cars. In case of Revenue generated Punjab is on the top followed by Chandigarh and Haryana whereas Assam is on the lowest position.

</a></p>

10. In this I have used Area Chart from which I came to know that Santro is on the Top in generating revenue followed by US18 whereas Maruti 800 is the last one followed by Hawk.

</a></p>

11. I have used Line Chart for presenting this relation in which I got that Car Insurance and Sold Price are directly-positive correlated means as Sold Price increases Car Insurance also increases in the same way and vice-versa. Car Insurance is highest in Punjab whereas least in Rajasthan and when we talk about State Tax, it is high in Punjab followed by Chandigarh and Karnataka whereas least in Rajasthan.

## Conclusion :

This project is helpful for both customers as well as companies. For customer, it will help them to know which brand is highly sold and which brand has affordable rate. For companies, it will help them to know which dealer can generate higher profit, which state has high rate of sales and which has low rate of sales, in which state different categories are sold and in what amount so that they can plan the strategy for maximizing their profit with lesser cost. They can also check that in which of the state, State Tax is higher and in which it is affordable in order to plan the minimum transportation cost. We can derive more information from this dashboard according to our requirement.
