# Automobile-Power-BI-Dashboard

## Introduction :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is about some specific Automobile brands. It contains data of cars like Alto, Beat, Santro, Hawk, Maruti 800 etc., its total sale, sold price, manager, dealers, consumer preference, zone, state and city in which it was sold of 2018-19. This makes easy to do comparision between these cars and where it is mostly sold. lastly it shows the top three and bottom three cars, states, and managers where quantities sold is highest or lowest. It covers the skill sets like Power BI as it is the best platform for data visualization in the most interactive ways. Also it shows various effective chart visuals which makes the dashboard easy to understand and attractive for the viewers. This will help the customers to compare between the best car brands and it will help the Car Companies to focus on those States where sale is higher than other States and plan for the future products according to that.

## This Project Includes :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Identifing the Problem
- Data Cleaning and Processing
- Performing Data Analysis and Interpretation
- Data Visualization
- Creation of Interactive Dashboard

## Project KPI :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Project, the measures display total quantity sold of the cars is 9673, total revenue generated is 313M, total State Tax paid is 4.29M and total Car Insurance paid is 28.45M. These are show in the form of KPI.

## Project Filters :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Project, there are two filters. First filter is month-wise which is there on the Revenue-Based Dashboard and second filter is Manager-wise which is on the Manager-Based Dashboard. Through these filters I got that in January, quantity sold and sold price together are high followed by Feburary month whereas both are low in July month. When we talk about Manager-wise then Rajat Mrig has done high sales than others but generated lesser revenue than others whereas Ruby Bhatia has done low sales than other. We can generate more information from the help of the filters as per our requirements.

## Project Tables :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Project, there were two Tables. First one is State-wise Quantity Sold and second one is State-wise Sold Price. From these tables, I got that Punjab has highest sale of cars followed by Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh whereas Assam has lowest sale of cars. In case of Revenue generated Punjab is on the top followed by Chandigarh and Haryana whereas Assam is on the lowest position.

## Insights of th Project :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project we have three Dashboards for more detailed analysis these are as follows:

### 1. Quantity Based Dashboard :
This is the first Dashboard in which comparison is done on the basis of Quantity od cars sold.
**1. Zone-wise Quantity Sold :** 
From this Pie Chart of Zone, I came to know that West Zone has highest sale of Cars i.e. 3k followed by South whereas East Zone has lowest sale of Cars i.e. 1k.

<a><img align="centre" src="https://github.com/Ritika821/Automobile-Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/Graphs/Quantity%20Based%20Dashboard/Qty%20Sold%20by%20Zone.png">
</a>

**2. Total Quantity Sold :**
Total quantity sold within period 2018-19 is 9673 Cars and crossed the target i.e. 8500 Cars, for which I have used Gauge Chart to dislpay it clearly.

<a><img align="centre" src="https://github.com/Ritika821/Automobile-Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/Graphs/Quantity%20Based%20Dashboard/Total%20Qty%20Sold.png">
</a>

**3. Quantity Sold by Category :**
I have used Line Chart for this data in which it shows that Basic Cars are mostly sold also followed by Luxury one whereas Extra Class Cars are least sold.

</a>

**4. Quantity Sold by States, Dealers and Cars :**
The three Bar Graphs are submerged in one through "drop down" arrow above the Chart ⬇️. First is State-wise where Punjab is on the top followed by Rajasthan whereas Assam is at the bottom position. Second is on the basis of Dealers in which Bulward is on the top position followed by Nike whereas Mitushi is at the bottom position. Now the last one is on the basis of Cars where ALto is on the top followed by Santro whereas Punto is at the last poition.

### 2. Revenue Based Dashboard :
This is the second Dashboard in which comparison is done on the basis of Revenue generated from the Cars.
**1. State & City wise Sold Price :**
The two Bar Graphs are submerged in one through "drop down" arrow above the Chart ⬇️. First is State-wise where Punjab is on the top followed by Chandigarh wheras Assam is the least in generating revenue. Second one is City-wise in which Patiala is on the top position followed by Sector 29 and Dwarka whereas Goalpara is the least revenue generator.

</a>
</p>

**2. Sold Price by Zone :**
In this I have used Funnel Chart which shows that West side has generated highest revenue followed by South whereas North and East has generated least revenue.

</a>

**3. Car Revenue :**
In this I have used Area Chart from which I came to know that Santro is on the Top in generating revenue followed by US18 whereas Maruti 800 is the last one followed by Hawk.

<a><img align="centre" src="https://github.com/Ritika821/Automobile-Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/Graphs/Revenue%20Based%20Dashboard/Car%20Revenue.png">
</a>

**4. Car Insurance & State Tax by States :**
I have used Line Chart for presenting this relation in which I got that Car Insurance and Sold Price are directly-positive correlated means as Sold Price increases Car Insurance also increases in the same way and vice-versa. Car Insurance is highest in Punjab whereas least in Rajsthan and when we talk about State Tax, it is high in Punjab followed by Chandigarh and Karnataka whereas least in Rajasthan.

</a>

### 3. Top-Bottom Base Dashboard :
This is the last Dashboard in which I have shown the top 3 and bottom 3 Managers, States and Cars. In this I have used Bar Chart with the filter on Cars to show the top and bottom 3.

## Conclusion :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is helpful for both customers as well as companies. For customer, it will help them to know which brand is highly sold and which brand has affordable rate. For companies, it will help them to know which dealer can generate higher profit, which state has high rate of sales and which has low rate of sales, in which state different categories are sold and in what amount so that they can plan the strategy for maximizing their profit with lesser cost. They can also check that in which state State Tax is higher and in which it is affordable in order to plan the minimum transportation cost. We can derive more information from this dashboard according to our requirement.
